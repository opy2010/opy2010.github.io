    <h2>GOOGL Real-Time Sniper Signal</h2>

    <div style="background:#f0f8ff;padding:20px;border-left:6px solid #2196F3;border-radius:8px;margin:20px 0;">
        <p style="font-size:1.6em;margin:0;color:#1976D2;font-weight:bold;">
            Decision: WAIT FOR PULLBACK
        </p>
        <p style="margin:10px 0 0;font-size:1.1em;">
            Entry Zone: 319.50 - 320.00 (consider if price consolidates near the daily MA20)<br>
            Stop Loss: 317.00 (below recent daily low)
        </p>
    </div>

    <h3>Market Environment (QQQ)</h3>
    <p><strong>Status:</strong> Choppy</p>

    <h3>GOOGL Multi-Timeframe Analysis</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Weekly Trend:</strong> Strong Uptrend (Weekly MA20 above price, RSI high but starting to cool), indicates potential for further gains, but also vulnerability to pullbacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Short-term Setup:</strong> Daily: Uptrend, but RSI is neutral and MACD is bearish, indicating potential consolidation or a minor pullback. 5-min: Price is mostly above MA20, but MACD is bearish. RSI neutral.</li>
        <li><strong>Relative Strength vs QQQ:</strong> Stronger than Market</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Core Reasoning</h3>
    <div style="background:#f9f9f9;padding:15px;border-radius:8px;font-size:0.95em;line-height:1.7;">
        GOOGL is showing relative strength and a strong weekly trend. However, the 5-min MACD is bearish, and the daily chart suggests a possible pullback. The current QQQ environment is choppy. It's prudent to wait for a dip towards the daily MA20 or a bullish signal on the 5-min chart before entering a long position. This strategy balances the bullish long-term trend with a more cautious short-term approach given the mixed signals.
